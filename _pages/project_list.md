### Project Details
List of projects that presented with poster and demos.
- [x] **Keystroke based Biometric Verification**

  [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dUFUGx_743ylqhF39uOjfoVtOHUu2dxO) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3J8bi3NcoUdhPiTUHFbWC-FynEcXKb-/)
  
  *<u>Summary</u>*: We use keystroke pattern of an individual for the biometric authentication method. The keyboard stroke patterns of a user are            continuously monitored, the flight and dwell time for each key are used, and the pattern of these extracted features is                  checked against the individual’s unique typing pattern to provide a continuous risk rating.

  [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11YoQIqFpQ08DTEhNkVo7TsPuy97rb4ek/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ELomtoeBde3cjbwk1CoYzjgwFmKWdeLK/view?usp=sharing)

  *<u>Summary</u>*: we have set a gunshot detection system with emphasis on quick response, robustness to external disturbances, and less runtime computations. For the achievement of these objectives we have utilized many comprehensive machine learning techniques, including support vector machines with various kernels, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, autoencoders and anomaly detection. By extracting a large set of features, training and testing on extensive dataset we were able to achieve best results in training and testing accuracy and in real time as well.
	
- [x] **Predicting Fault Regime of Operation of Train Car**
	 [[Poster]]() [[Report]]()	

	*<u>Summary</u>*: Fault prediction in a complex mechanical system is one of the interesting topics for researchers. The goal of our project is to predict faulty regimes of a train car. The system we considered has accelerometers mounted on several parts and the dataset contains training and testing experiments. With the help of simplified physics based model we deduced 21 subsystems to detect any fault. We implemented Principle Component Analysis (PCA) anomaly detection by extracting data patterns from all training experiments and then each testing experiment has been classified either healthy or unhealthy. In the case of unhealthy experiment, faulty subsystem is detected.


- [x] **Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction**
	 
	 [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10rS3jWtyG8Xs97eVwAtH4cNFhW8uH9p8/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10rS3jWtyG8Xs97eVwAtH4cNFhW8uH9p8/view?usp=sharing)	

	*<u>Summary</u>*:  We proposed a practical, software-only framework, based on deep learning, for accelerating MRI scan time allows maintaining good quality imaging with CS-MRI. This is accomplished by partial MRI sampling, while using an adversarial neural network to estimate the missing samples. The inter-play between the generator and the discriminator networks enables the introduction of an adversarial cost in addition to a fidelity loss used for optimizing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
