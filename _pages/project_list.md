## Project Details
List of projects that presented with poster and demos.
-  **Keystroke based Biometric Verification**

	  [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dUFUGx_743ylqhF39uOjfoVtOHUu2dxO) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3J8bi3NcoUdhPiTUHFbWC-FynEcXKb-/)
	  
	  *<u>Summary</u>*: We use keystroke pattern of an individual for the biometric authentication method. The keyboard stroke patterns of a user are            continuously monitored, the flight and dwell time for each key are used, and the pattern of these extracted features is                  checked against the individual’s unique typing pattern to provide a continuous risk rating.

-  **Predicting Fault Regime of Operation of Train Car**
	 [[Poster]]() [[Report]]()	

	*<u>Summary</u>*: Fault prediction in a complex mechanical system is one of the interesting topics for researchers. The goal of our project is to predict faulty regimes of a train car. The system we considered has accelerometers mounted on several parts and the dataset contains training and testing experiments. With the help of simplified physics based model we deduced 21 subsystems to detect any fault. We implemented Principle Component Analysis (PCA) anomaly detection by extracting data patterns from all training experiments and then each testing experiment has been classified either healthy or unhealthy. In the case of unhealthy experiment, faulty subsystem is detected.

	 [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10rS3jWtyG8Xs97eVwAtH4cNFhW8uH9p8/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10rS3jWtyG8Xs97eVwAtH4cNFhW8uH9p8/view?usp=sharing)	

	*<u>Summary</u>*:  We proposed a practical, software-only framework, based on deep learning, for accelerating MRI scan time allows maintaining good quality imaging with CS-MRI. This is accomplished by partial MRI sampling, while using an adversarial neural network to estimate the missing samples. The inter-play between the generator and the discriminator networks enables the introduction of an adversarial cost in addition to a fidelity loss used for optimizing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

-  **Cricket Win Prediction**	

	 [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKPckYBEgZ89eTRy_fe56gI2JGN2c-XM/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZtJJQrXkYxePpGLADLVtNuHVj6Q_sL3X/view?usp=sharing)	

	*<u>Summary</u>*: T20 is the shortest format of cricket and essentially the most exciting one. A T-20 game can tilt towards either side within a span of 3, 4 overs. This makes the outcome prediction of T20 match a real challenging problem. To overcome this challenge, we used team and player level statistics coupled with the score and wickets information at different intervals in 2 nd innings, in our machine learning model. Understandably, best results were achieved on predicting the outcome close to the end of 2 nd innings. Logistic Regression and SVM provided best results with overall accuracy of 84%.

	*<u>Summary</u>*: CNNs are translation invariant but not rotation invariant. To make CNNs rotation invariant, ORNs are designed that can detect rotated images with high accuracy and less number of training parameters.
	
-  **Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation**

	 [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TTEYBQhdRaxk5u2P4DZ-eMq7Ei7oAyfz/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wnvmF9SRHUKC25EakAA1H3p1Ag2IJSPk/view?usp=sharing)	

	*<u>Summary</u>*: Domain Adaptation is one of the major problems in Semantic Segmentation where each pixel is labeled as a separate class. A solution is devised in-order to adapt the domain during semantic segmentation. The devised solution tries to adapt the target domain along with source domain using GANs approach. An experiment with fine tuning is also performed. The overall performance of the system is improved on target domain after adaptation on Cityscapes and WAD dataset respectively.
	
-  **Urdu Speech to Text Using Transfer Learning**

	 [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FxNr4SU6nFPXkRnt2WA-2-BlXB1GyIaL/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19vNWXqxXYVwv2ICYUz0jExH7zaub4sTL/view?usp=sharing)	

	*<u>Summary</u>*: Traditional automatic speech recognition system was composed of acoustic model (AM), pronunciation model (PM), and language model (LM) which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines. In contrast end-to-end speech recognition systems do not need hand-designed components. Our approach uses well optimized RNNs that uses GPU to train the model.
	
-  **Offline Urdu Image to Text Recognition/Writer's Gender Identification**

	 [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NpdAES8yd85w05Btkif2j0_6u_faZb7f/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mHBrbH_gvLXeWZvkUtGTef9O0ILHgnXA/view?usp=sharing)	

	*<u>Summary</u>*: This project has two main features: Offline URDU optical character recognition. Writer’s Identification for urdu text. Offline Urdu character recognition means it will predict the written text on an image. The word “offline” means it will predict the already written text in an image. While “online ocr” means ocr that predicts the character while writing on real time. There are many OCR available for English. But there are very few for urdu and those which are available uses an old approach of “many notations of single character” like below. My project uses End to end solution. It is using deep-learning techniques to predict the characters.
	
-  ** Estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Bearings**	

	 [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsC9Vk04kBPAZBALs5Puk2HMoB92cZf_/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bEj79tyQM2G1XhCN-_PCHgguw5LZKbEx/view?usp=sharing)	

	*<u>Summary</u>*: Having precise estimates of when ball bearings should be replaced can help achieve higher efficiency and ensure safety. We used ball bearing’s vibrations to estimate their remaining useful life (RUL). Features from time, frequency and time-frequency domain were extracted. Their selection was done according to their correlation and monotonicity with time. These were then fused together with LSTM. Double exponential smoothing gave the RUL.
	
-  **Predicting E-Commerce Order Returns - An application of Machine Learning**	

	 [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PCqC06W39i0LwSrCP2EVELRFzn2cUvbN/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pbLi7zDYPTa5CqvkSLEH81ro8YO74h5l/view?usp=sharing)	

	*<u>Summary</u>*: One of the biggest challenge that an e-commerce venture is facing on a daily basis is the order return and cancellation rate. These returns not only cost delivery charges but also the opportunity cost of selling product through a valid order. In this paper, we will use historic online purchase data obtained from one of the biggest e-commerce platform in Pakistan and try to predict products that will be returned or cancelled. These predictions will then allow us to intervene in the product delivery cycle well in advance and avoid the costs associated with returned/cancelled orders.
	
-  **Optimal Detection of Side Channel Attacks on Cache Memory using Machine Learning**

	 [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B7IQ9UZBKFWBBqh1YVi1t653VAJ3hSWS/view?usp=sharing) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1umR1j7Rn1qU-8-uLcrg_DZztOFjeOjaO/view?usp=sharing)	

	*<u>Summary</u>*: In computing, active data is often cached to shorten data access times, reduce latency and improve input/output. Because almost all application workload is dependent upon I/O operations, caching is used to improve application performance. Various attacks like prime+probe, flush+reload and flush+flush are purposed to steal important information by targeting caches using side channel methods. Flush + flush is stealth in nature and not detectable using available methods. I am designing tool to detect flush+flush.
