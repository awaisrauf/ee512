- [x] **Keystroke based Biometric Verification**
  [[Poster]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dUFUGx_743ylqhF39uOjfoVtOHUu2dxO) [[Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3J8bi3NcoUdhPiTUHFbWC-FynEcXKb-/)
  Summary: We use keystroke pattern of an individual for the biometric authentication method. The keyboard stroke patterns of a user are            continuously monitored, the flight and dwell time for each key are used, and the pattern of these extracted features is                  checked against the individual’s unique typing pattern to provide a continuous risk rating.
